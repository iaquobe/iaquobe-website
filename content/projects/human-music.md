## $whatis human-music
Human music is a script I wrote that generates music, and uploads it to Youtube. 
It does not upload anymore, since the Youtube uploader I was
relying also stopped working.

The already published music videos nevertheless still be found on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDfNLU_M0MK3WOsIsScWirw)

The code for this project is published on [Github](https://github.com/iaquobe/human-music)

### how it works
Its not as complicated as is might sound. First it creates MIDI with randomized
variables (like bpm, notes, note progressions, instruments, ...). 

After the round about 2 minute long MIDI is generated, it is transformed to a
video with a static background image.

Lastly the video is uploaded to youtube with a tool I found on Github.
Sadly this tool does not work anymore, since Youtube has changed some things, so
there are no more new music videos uploaded.
