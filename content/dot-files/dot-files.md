You can find my dot files on [Github](https://github.com/iaquobe/archbox)
Contrary to what the name suggests, this is not for arch, but for Fedora.
The name is from the beginnings. 
Since then I moved away from arch, because of
issues with nvme during the installation process. 

I have been using this repository since April 2020 to configure my desktop
environment, in it you can find my settings for: 

### i3
bindings, integration with pywal


### nvim
Pluggins includings lsp, goyo, fzf.

keybindings and language settings.


### kitty
configuration for ligatures and nerdfonts.
Apart from that its pretty much default.

### dunst
notification deamon, the only modifications are cosmetic.

### polybar
shows: workspaces, memory usage, bluetooth/wifi connection, brightness, volume,
keyboard, battery, time, ...
